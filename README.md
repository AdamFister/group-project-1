# Group Project 1

1. Designate one person from your group to fork this repo.
2. Once the repo has been forked, everyone in the group can clone that repo and work on their own development branch for their stories.
3. Make a new branch for each story you work on
4. Communicate with your team for completed stories, pull requests (merging branches, and pulling the new master into your working branch), and especially for merge conflicts.
