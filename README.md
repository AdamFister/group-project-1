# Group Project 1

1. Designate one person from your group to fork this repo; do not clone yet.
2. Same person should now generate the `vue create myrepo` file structure in your top level Sites folder.
3. Set a new remote from the forked repo on git to point at your locally created git repo: `add, commit, set origin, push`
4. Everyone in the group can now clone that repo and work on their own development branch for their stories.
5. Make a new branch for each story you work on (use some kind of shortened name for the branch based on the story you work on - no spaces in github branch names)
6. Communicate with your team for completed stories, pull requests (merging branches, and pulling the new master into your working branch), and especially for merge conflicts.
